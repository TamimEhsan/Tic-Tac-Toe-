# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple tic tac toe with a networking twist.
Used JavaFX and Java socket. Feel free to download and try. Due to lack of dedicated IP it is written for local host. You can use this on the same device or two device in the same network. At first launch the server side then the client side.
